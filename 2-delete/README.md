# Debug Files Archive

This directory contains debug and analysis files created during the research phase for implementing 5-hour window detection and plan auto-detection.

## Created During Analysis Phase (July 15, 2025)

These files were used to:
- Analyze Claude usage patterns in JSONL files
- Research 5-hour window detection logic
- Investigate plan auto-detection strategies  
- Understand token usage and limit patterns
- Prototype sliding window algorithms

## Status: No Longer Needed

All insights from these analysis scripts have been incorporated into:
- **PROPOSAL.md** - Final implementation plan
- Research findings documented in commit messages

## Contents

### Python Analysis Scripts (17 files)
Scripts for analyzing conversation patterns, limit detection, and usage windows

### JSON Data Files (10 files) 
Results and configurations from analysis runs

### Reports (2 markdown files)
Detailed analysis reports on conversation duration and usage patterns

## Safe to Delete

These files can be safely deleted once the implementation in PROPOSAL.md is complete.
They are archived here for reference during development if needed.
